<br />
Tested on 2.3.4 Responsive Gold<br />
<br />
1) Fixed service exclusions config - was not working on USA or INT quotes.<br />
<br />
2) Corrected the way rates are where being received - the original author had set to receive the rate including taxes (due) - when they are typically added by the store owner using a Tax Class.<br />
Rates are now received without taxes (base) - and (as mentioned above) are added by the store owner by setting a tax in the module.<br />
<br />
3) Handling fee for both fixed and percent fixed<br />
<br />
4) Removed duplicate $this-_title<br />
<br />
5) Added shipping zone config.<br />
<br />
6) Added expected delivery date and a Enter Turn Around Time Config.<br />
<br />
